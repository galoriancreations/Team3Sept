      <p>
On August 2, 2015, the UN created <strong>17 GOALS</strong> for the
        sustainable development of humanity, achieved by 2030. Goals that we, as
        human beings, must achieve together, if we want to improve the condition
        of         the planet and of all life on it. We have about a decade, until 2030,
        to completely change the way we consume energy, maintain agriculture,
        manage water, talk to our neighbors, and more. This is not a passing
        trend, but a global change in our habits, eating habits, consumption
        habits, the way we do business, social responsibility, and long-term
        thinking.

        18 Days of Sustainability & Leadership
      </SectionHeading>
      <section class="days-18__subsection">
        <p>
          18-day challenge that is designed to allow players from one or two
          clubs from various countries to collaborate taking a social group
          process inspired by the UN SDG’s Sustainable Development Goals. The
          various friendly training games include fascinating tasks such as
          listening to relevant TED talks and thinking exercises that connect
          you to ‘The right place’ and to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every day the group manager posts on WhatsApp the daily challenges.
          The challenge allows you to choose at least one short daily task from
          three tasks, and it opens you up to a magical process of growth and
          new awareness, which will disconnect you from the immediate comfort
          zone and develop global awareness in you. The professional games allow
          players to create their own tasks and collaborate in a unique and
          fascinating way never seen before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many who have completed all 18 days report positive changes in their
          personal lives and in general.

          The 18 Days of Sustainability and Leadership Challenge is a social
          group process inspired by the sustainable development goals set by the
          United Nations, aimed at evolving and changing the reality in which we
          live. This is not a passing trend, but a global change in our habits,
          eating habits, consumption habits, the way we do business, social
          responsibility, and long-term thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          We invite you change angels, teachers and students to enter the global
          game and influence the future of the entire human race. Join me for an
          18-day challenge, where each day we will focus on one of the goals in
          order, and end with another ‘H+’ goal for the future of humanity.
