            Participate in a given Challenge 18 Group.
          </li>
          <li>
            18 days before you start your own Challenge 18 group,
            <NuxtLink to="/login">log into the Ting Global website</NuxtLink>,
            set a template and start date for your challenge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              Choose a topic of your interest, for example:
              <strong>Climate Action</strong>, <strong>Education</strong> or
              <strong>Cultural Exchange</strong>.
            </span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Add new material such as text, audio and visuals to your
                challenge, you can also translate your challenge into other
                languages for other people.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can choose to place new tasks and TED talks in your
                challenge.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can choose to place a virtual ball to pass among players,
                e.g. a video whereas you present the daily goal from your point
                of view and then name another player in the group to be the next
                to upload such a video and challenge the next player in turn, so
                once there are 18 players in total to pass the virtual ball, the
                complete group will receive extra 18 points.
              </li>
              <li>
                Run a simulation to make sure all is to your satisfaction.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              Organize a group of 3-5 friends to help you invite people to the
              group and get the players engaged.

                Instagram or WhatsApp etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Contact and invite at least one organization (company/academia/
