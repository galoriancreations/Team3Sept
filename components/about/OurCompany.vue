        <strong>Problem</strong> – Humanity is experiencing a global crisis and
        most people are unaware of the conditions of our world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Need</strong> – A program to aid individuals’ interests,
        understanding, and involvement in relation to the Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDGs) encouraging a sense of global citizenship.

        <strong>Solution</strong> – Meet Challenge 18! An informal education and
        social platform, inspired by the UN’s SDGs, that was designed to create
        a positive social change by nurturing a sense of global citizenship and
        fostering connections between international communities.
