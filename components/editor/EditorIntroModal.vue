      Welcome to the Challenge & Template Editor
    </h3>
    <div class="editor-intro__text">
      <p>
        On this page you can select which tasks you want to include in your
        challenge, and possibly customize your own challenge template.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're using an editable template (or creating your own new
        template), you can use this editor to:
      </p>
      <ul class="diamond-bullet-list">
        <li>Change the name and language of the template.</li>
        <li>Edit the title of each day in the template.</li>
        <li>
          Add/remove days to the template, add/remove tasks on each day, and
          add/remove options on each task.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mark or unmark tasks as a bonus, and choose how many points (between 1
          and 18) to award for each bonus task.
        </li>
        <li>Edit all existing options.</li>
        <li>
          Add, edit or remove messages that would be sent to participants during
          the challenge, or the days before the challenge.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some of our public templates are not editable. If you chose such a
        template, you can't make all these customizations â€“ you can only use the
        existing tasks and options in the template.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each task in your template, you have to choose one option that would
        be included in the challenge itself. You can click the Shuffle button at
        the bottom to pick a random option for every task. All other options
        will remain a part of your template, and could be chosen when creating
        other challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        All changes you make on this page will be auto-saved as a draft into
        your account (you'll find it under <strong>My Drafts</strong> in
        <RouterLink to="/dashboard">your dashboard</RouterLink>), so you can
        always continue editing right from where you paused, even after logging
        out. In addition, a custom template you build here will be auto-saved
        and added into your stock of available templates, so you can later use
        it to open more challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you click the <strong>Publish Challenge</strong> button, your draft
        will be published as a live, active challenge, and users will be able to
        join it. You'll receive a link you can use to invite users to the
        challenge.
